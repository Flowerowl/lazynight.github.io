这一刻，再一次蜷缩在自己渺小的空间中，无所不能。  
It is the summer night&#8217;s goodbye.

My only lady she&#8217;s gone by.

I think I&#8217;m almost dead.

I&#8217;m dead， is the end?

It is raining in my heart.

Everything tears me apart.

I think it terrible.

I&#8217;m dead， is the end?

Yes， on my life，

No more of friend，

No more of love to me，

No more of faith to me.

Yes， on my life，

No more of sadness，

No more of happiness，

No more of loneliness.

There ain&#8217;t no second chance to say?

My mind is breaking and

my heart is shaking forever， forever.

Yes， on my life，

No more of friend，

No more of love to me，

No more of faith to me.

Yes， on my life，

No more of sadness，

No more of happiness，

No more of loneliness.

It is the end?

It is the summer night&#8217;s goodbye.

My only lady she&#8217;s gone by.

I think I&#8217;m almost dead.

I&#8217;m dead， is the end?

It is raining in my heart.

Everything tears me apart.

I think it terrible.

I&#8217;m dead， is the end?

Yes， on my life，

No more of friend，

No more of love to me，

No more of faith to me.

Yes， on my life，

No more of sadness，

No more of happiness，

No more of loneliness.

There ain&#8217;t no second chance to say?

My mind is breaking and

my heart is shaking forever， forever.

Yes， on my life，

No more of friend，

No more of love to me，

No more of faith to me.

Yes， on my life，

No more of sadness，

No more of happiness，

No more of loneliness.

It is the end?
