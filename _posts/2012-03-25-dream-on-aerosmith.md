Every time that I “look in” the mirror  
“All these lines on my face getting clearer”  
The past is gone  
It went by like dusk to dawn  
Isn’t that the way  
Everyboby’s got their dues in life to pay  
Yesh, I know nobody knows  
Where it comes and where it goes  
I know it’s everybody’s sin  
“You got to lose to know how to win”  
Half my life’s in book’s written pages  
Live and learn from fools and from sages  
You know it’s true  
All the things come back to you  
Sing with me, sing for the years  
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears  
Sing with me, if it’s just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good lord will take you away  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
Dream yourself a dream come true  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
And dream until your dream comes true  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on
