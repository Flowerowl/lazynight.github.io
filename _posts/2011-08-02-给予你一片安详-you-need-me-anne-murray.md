歌词:

I cried a tear, you wiped it dry  
I was confused, you cleared my mind  
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me  
And held me up and gave me dignity  
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again  
To face the world out on my own again  
You put me high upon a pedestal  
So high that I could almost see eternity  
You needed me, you needed me

And I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s you  
I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s true  
I needed you and you were there  
And I&#8217;ll never leave, why should I leave?  
I&#8217;d be a fool &#8217;cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold  
When I was lost you took me home  
You gave me hope when I was at the end  
And turned my lies back into truth again  
You even called me &#8220;friend&#8221;

You gave me strength to stand alone again  
To face the world out on my own again  
You put me high upon a pedestal  
So high that I could almost see eternity  
You needed me, you needed me

You needed me, you needed me

这是昨天刚发现的一首歌，平静如老人在回忆往事。

娓娓道来的声音，带着旧味的配乐，让人闻到了淡然，平和的味道。
