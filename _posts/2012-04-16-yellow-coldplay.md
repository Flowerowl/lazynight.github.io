这首Yellow 应该是最早听到的英伦摇滚了。

偶然翻出来依然能带给你无尽的感动应该就是经典了吧。

昨晚午夜，抵不住乏力正要歇息，突然一阵让人颤栗的鼓点随着贝斯高昂的让人瞬间火热，

还是那个低沉沙哑的声音，还是那样的氛围，

像个老友，给你一丝默契，

带着过去，好像未来不再恐惧。

Look at the stars; look how they shine for you  
And everything you do  
Yeah, they were all yellow  
I came along; I wrote a song for you  
And all the things you do

And it was called yellow  
So then I took my turn  
Oh what a thing to have done  
And it was all yellow  
Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones  
Turn into something beautiful  
D&#8217;you know?  
You know I love you so  
You know I love you so

I swam across; I jumped across for you  
Oh what a thing to do  
Cos you were all yellow  
I drew a line; I drew a line for you  
Oh what a thing to do

And it was all yellow  
And your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones  
Turn into something beautiful  
D&#8217;you know?  
For you I bleed myself dry  
For you I bleed myself dry

It&#8217;s true  
Look how they shine for you  
Look how they shine for you  
Look how they shine for?  
Look how they shine for you  
Look how they shine for you  
Look how they shine  
Look at the starsLook how they shine for you  
And all the things that you do
