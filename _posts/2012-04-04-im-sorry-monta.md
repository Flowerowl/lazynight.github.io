Lyrics:  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
As the rain starts pouring down  
You&#8217;re looking at the ground  
Summer dust get&#8217;s washed away  
Lucky you, you&#8217;ve lost it all  
Take the big part &#8211; go for all  
I′m soaked to the bone and could easily call you now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
It′s for you, erase my mind  
Save me, catch me just in time  
Cracking up is normal for you and me  
Keep the secret safe and quiet  
there&#8217;s a low &#8211; i&#8217;m on your side  
Holding the gold, which is made of paper & stone  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me  
I&#8217;m sorry, you got me now
